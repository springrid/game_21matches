# Reinforcement Learning playing: 21 matches

21 matches is a classic two player game that you can play by yourself or against your friends.
The rules are:
- The game starts with 21 match sticks.
- You can remove 1 or 2 or 3 or 4 match sticks on your turn.
- The player forced to pick the last match stick loses the game.

Agents thus far implemented:
- random
- perfect
- human/user
- Monte Carlo

### TODO:
 - add other agents :)
 - other games ;)
